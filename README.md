# DahBersih-Cleaning-Service-Website
Cleaning Service Company

My team and I were assigned to create any dynamic website using ASP.NET framework. We created a cleaning service company that provides cleaning services since it is relatable to the current pandemic. The main users are non-registered users, registered users and admin.

Non-Registered User
A non-registered user is a user who is interested in purchasing cleaning services through DahBersih web application, wanting to know more about provided services, prices, terms and conditions. Non-registered users are potential clients of the company who may ask additional questions on the platform for better understanding of the company’s scope.

Registered User
A registered user is a user who signed up into the system by providing some necessary personal details to create a personal account in the system. Registered users can enjoy all features of the DahBersih web application such as book services, edit profile, and give feedback. 

Admin
Admin is the user who can update booking status, approve or disapprove feedback, and modify services in terms of size of property and price, and terms and conditions. Basically, admin manages the whole DahBersih system.

Project Scope
•	The web application will display all the services available in DahBersih where the customer can choose either of them.
•	The web application allows customers to register and login. These data will be stored for future processing.
•	Only once a customer is login, the customer can book the service.
•	A customer is able to book services only if he or she is logged in.
•	Customers can also update their profiles if there were any previous mistakes made or changes required.
•	Customers can give feedbacks in the guest book section regarding the service they ordered. The feedbacks can be referenced as future improvements. Customers can also ask questions and the response to the questions will be replied through emails.
•	The admin can view customers, manage feedbacks, manage bookings and manage services.
